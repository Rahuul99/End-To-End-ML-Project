# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model. The project uses the following technologies:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Docker
- Kubernetes

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: contains the raw and processed data used in the project.
- `models/`: contains the trained machine learning models.
- `notebooks/`: contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and model training.
- `src/`: contains the source code for the Flask web application.
- `Dockerfile`: defines the Docker image used to run the Flask application.
- `requirements.txt`: lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `run.py`: runs the Flask application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/end-to-end-ml-project.git
    ```

2. Install the Python dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Train the machine learning model:

    ```
    python train.py
    ```

4. Run the Flask application:

    ```
    python run.py
    ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Deployment

The project can be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes. To deploy the project, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

    ```
    docker build -t end-to-end-ml-project .
    ```

2. Push the Docker image to a container registry:

    ```
    docker push your-username/end-to-end-ml-project
    ```

3. Deploy the application to Kubernetes:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model using Python, Scikit-learn, Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes. Feel free to use this project as a starting point for your own end-to-end machine learning projects.
